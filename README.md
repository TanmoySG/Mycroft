# Mycroft 
 
Mycroft is an one stop Encrytion service for your data. It uses [RSA ALgorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) for Encryption & Decryption.

[Learn how RSA works and its Python Implementation here.](https://github.com/TanmoySG/Cryptography-Algorithm/tree/master/RSA-Algorithm) 

No data is stored, locally or online making it even more secure. You can generate new keys or use your existing keys for Encryption and Decryption.

This project is built with React and Flask. It uses [Google Material Design](https://material.io/) based UI React framework, [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) for its design.

Mycroft currently supports Encryption using RSA. More encryption algorithms and services to be added soon.
